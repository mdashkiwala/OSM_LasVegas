# OSM_LasVegas

The project was carried out in order to strengthen my data cleaning techniques. An OSM XML data file of Las Vegas area was scraped for relevant data and then the same was tidied and made consistent. Cleaned data was further exported to SQL tables and explored. 

Contents:
Markdown file for Python code and SQL queries.
Small sample of XML file. The complete raw XML file used in the project can be found on the link given below.
